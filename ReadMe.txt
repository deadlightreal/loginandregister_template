1. Visit the official Apache Friends website at https://www.apachefriends.org and download XAMPP.

2. After downloading XAMPP, navigate to the XAMPP installation folder. For example, it could be located at C:\xampp. Inside this folder, find the "htdocs" directory and place your project folder inside it.

3. Launch the XAMPP Control Panel and click the "Start" button next to both Apache and MySQL to start the web server and the database server.

4. Now, access the MySQL admin interface by clicking the "Admin" button next to MySQL in the XAMPP Control Panel. In the MySQL admin interface, you can either:

5. Create a new database named "loginandregister," or
If you prefer a different database name, make sure to update the database name inside the dbConnection.php file within your project.
Inside the database, create a table with the following specifications:

6.  Create a column named "id" and set it to AUTO_INCREMENT.
    Create a VARCHAR column named "username."
    Create a VARCHAR column named "email."
    Create a VARCHAR column named "password."

7. Finally, to access your project, open a web browser and go to http://localhost:8080/LoginANDRegister/RegisterScreen.php. Note that you should replace "8080" with the actual port number configured in your XAMPP setup.
